def draw_rectangle_pattern, use all parameters given
    start for loop from 0 to 360 with step of 360/count
        random the color
        get distance for each point of circle, using module given, set a variable in x and y directions
        draw the rectangle at location, make rotation angle change with degree and add rotation. make rotate by top left
        drawly.draw()

def draw_circle_pattern, use all parameters given
    for loop with same parameters as previous for loop
        random the color
        get distance for each point of circle using module given, add the radius of circles, and set variables for positions in x and y directions
        draw the circle with x and y position as specified before as well as radius from input
        drawly.draw()

def draw_super_pattern with parameters of only num of patterns
    make variables for parameters so random numbers stay within boundaries
    for loop with range of num patterns to repeat patterns as needed
        make a random variable choose between 2 options, rectangle or circle
        if statement to decide which function the randint chose
            draw_rectangle_pattern with randints as all parameters, use variables from before as boundaries
        if statement to decide which function the randint chose
            draw_circle_pattern with randints as all parameters, use variables from before as boundaries


within main:
    adjust main funciton to add inputs for all necesary parameters, just follow which parameters are given.
