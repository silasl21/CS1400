1. Paste in the designated code from the assignment into the main task2.py file
    - fill in import spot to import draw_chessboard from chessboard.py
    - fill in code to get the input from the user
        1. Get the start x-coordinate for the top left corner
        2. Get the starting y-coordinate for the top left corner
        3. Get the width (if they don't input anything it is ok)
        4. get the height (again, if they don't input anything it is ok)
Functions
    draw_chessboard(start_x, start_y, width=250, height=250)
      * parameters are from starter code, width and height are set to default to 250 due to instructions *

        1. Start drawly
        2. Set drawly speed to 10 so that things happen quickly
        3. call draw_rectangle() to draw the border and make sure that the border value is True
        4. call draw_all_rectangles() to draw the inner part of the chessboard
        5. call drawly.done()

    draw_rectangle(start_x, start_y, width, height, border=False)
        * parameters are set to go with requirements. This function is just basically a shortcut for a drawly rectangle. The border is typically set to false

        0a. set the color to black
        1. set a conditional to say that if border is true, create a variable that is 1 for stroke width, otherwise make sure that it stays at zero (if/else)
        2. create a rectangle using the parameters set in the function using drawly.rectangle
        3. call drawly.draw()

    draw_all_rectangles(start_x, start_y, width, height)
        start a variable to determine the x and y of each little rectangle

        1. use a for loop for each of the 8 rows
            1. set the x position to the left side of the board
            - if  the row number is even
                - add 1/8 the width of the board to the initial x value
            2. create another for loop for the 4 rectangles inside each row
                - draw a rectangle using the width and height divided by 8 and the newly set x and y values, make sure that the border value i
                - add 2/8 the width of the board to the initial x-value
                
            3. move the y position to the next line adding the 1/8 the height to the original y-value
