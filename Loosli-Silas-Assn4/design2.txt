1. import drawly
2. Give a welcome to the program message
3. Prompt the user for:
    Superhero name
    Body size - This is the diameter of their body.
    Location - X, Y location. Use two prompts to get this
    Arm length
    Leg length
            ** make sure the leg length is longer than the arm length with a loop telling them to input values until they get it right
    Sword length
            ** The arm length plus the sword length must be longer than the leg length. Start another loop to get it right until they do get it right
    Voice power (distance from center of body)
            ** The voice power must be longer than the arm length plus sword length. Start another loop to make sure they get it right this time
4. Welcome the superhero to the stage
4a. Give them a hard time if they are not ready and an easy time if they are
5. Prompt the user for the villain
    name
    body size (also diameter)
    location
6. Give a scalding message to enter the villain into the stage
7. Display "Hit enter to help {superhero_name} fight {villain_name}"
8. Create a drawly window
    title it {superhero_name} vs. {villain_name}
    draw the superhero
        black dot for the superhero
    draw the villain
        red dot for the villain
    draw the rings for attack radii (all of these are thin circles)
        arm_attack == radius + arm_length -- wheat color
        leg_attack == radius + leg_length -- blue color
        sword_attack == radius + arm_length + sword_length -- grey color
        voice_attack -- yellow color
9. Determine the total distance between the superhero and the villain
    distance == ((villain_x - superhero_x) ** 2 + (villain_y - superhero_y) ** 2) ** 0.5
10. use the distance between the superhero and the villain to determine what the closest attack could be
    print out a special message for each attack
        ** account for the radius of both the superhero and the villain while doing this

funny message:
print("Keep in mind this situation is highly theoretical, don't try this at home")
