2. Indent a line to get the user to enter a year (4 digits)
3. loop until the user enters a 4-digit number and no letters
4. make a blank line between the input and output
5. Calculate if the 4-digit number is a leap year

    - figure out what the first 2 digits are
        - Integer divide by 100
    - figure out what the 3rd digit is
        - subtract the first 2 numbers from the original
        - integer divide by 10
    - figure out what the 4th digit is
        - subtract the first 3 numbers from the original
    
    Cases for it being a leap year in the Fronkian Calendar
    -Case 1
        - the year is divisible by 9
        - the last 2 digits of the year do not match
    -Case 2
        - the sum of the lst 2 digits equals the first 2 digits

        - the 3rd digit is even
               - use the second to 4th digit and modulus it with 2 to output 0

        - the 3rd digit is less than the 4th digit
            - simple logical operator comparing the 2 4th digits
