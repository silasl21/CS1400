import random
import time
0a. paste in the extra code from the assignment
1. Open a drawly window, give it a black background. drawly.start(An Unassuming Thermometer, (720, 720), "black")
1a. give a welcome statment and introduce the user to the game. Prompt the user using input to continue.
2. Create a scene, using a function definition: redraw(score)
    - have a point score set by the score in redraw(score)
        - use drawly.text(f"Score: {score}") of some size that fits the screen well in the top left corner
    - create a thermometer with 2 boxes that is a total of 500 pixels tall using 2 drawly.rectangle() functions
    - don't call drawly.draw during the function definition otherwise it will be a blocky sorta change
3. create a function, question()
    - use random to create 2 different random integers from 1 to 100 in 2 variables called num1 and num2
    - add those together in a variable, sum
4. ask the question in a defined function
    - start a variable called start_time using time.time()
    - ask what the 2 numbers added together are with user_answer = int(input(f"\t{num1} + {num2} = "))
    - recored elapsed time by using elapsed_time = time.time() - start time
    - set a variable answer = False
5. get the point value from the answer using a defined function
        - if elapsed_time <= 0 sec:
            - score_change = game.POINT_LIST[0}
        - elif elapsed_time <= 2:
            - score_change = game.POINT_LIST[1]
        - elif elapsed_time <= 3:
            - score_change = game.POINT_LIST[2]
        - elif elapsed_time <= 4:
            - score_change = game.POINT_LIST[3]
        - else:
            - score_change += game.POINT_LIST[4]
    - if answer: -- meaning if the answer is true
        score += score_change
    - else:
        score -= score_change
     return the score change because score will already be returned

6. Create an animation function
    - 6 if statements:
    ** if the bar is going to go over one of the edges, stop the loop immediately
        - if the answer is incorrect and the points negative
            - start a for statement that will move the red negative bar downwards. simple addition of i to the height
        - if the answer is correct and the points are negative
            - start a for statement that will move the red negative bar upwards. break it if the bar gets to the middle
            - if the score > zero, change the color to green and continue to move up
        - if the answer is correct and the points are positive
            - start a for statement that will move the green positive bar upwards
        - if the answer is incorrect and the points are positive
            - start a for statement that will move the green bar down, break if the bar gets to the center
            - if the score is less than 0, switch the color to red and continue downwards
        - if the answer is correct and the points are zero
            - start a for statement that brings the green bar up
        - if the answer is incorrect and the points are zero
            - start a for statement that brings the red bar down
        - redraw inside every for statement that is decreasing the bar size

       if the question is correct, if statement for if the bar is negative and if statement for if the bar is positive
       if the question is incorrect, if statement for if the bar is positive and if it is alrady negative
