Flight software is essential for everything that goes into the air. It lets humans concentrate on what they need to do and not how to get there, doing the calculations necessary to keep an object in orbit or in the atmosphere. A while ago I was able to sit in on a CubeSat conference where they talked about the flight software F’ (F Prime), and I was able to learn about this software using C++ framework created specifically for small satellites and other projects. Basically, this means that it is more for small scale projects and students that are creating their own small satellites. It is completely free and developed for people like me. This was super intriguing to me because this software was created from code sort of like what we are doing in python, but it is powerful enough to control satellites and their orbits, keep them moving for years without much adjustment. Deeper than that, it is all 1’s and 0’s, turning circuits on and off. Every software I use was coded by somebody using various languages, all telling this computer and whatever device I am using exactly how to work.
